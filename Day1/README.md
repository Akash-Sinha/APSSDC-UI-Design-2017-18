### Concepts

* HTML
  * Hyper Text Markup Language
  * Rendered by Web Browsers
  * Used to structure content on a web page
  * Many versions - 1, 2, ...4.01, 5
  * Consists of 'Tags' -> `<tagname>`
  * An Element is an entire block - `<tag></tag>`
  * HTML files have the extension `.html`
  * A HTML file can be opened in a
    * Text Editor which displays all tags and content
    * Browser which renders all tags and displays the content in a structured manner
* Browsers
  * Types
    * Chrome - Lastest features, Fast, Secure, Extensions
    * Firefox - Good features, Secure, Plugins, Takes lot of space, MDN
    * Edge
    * Safari
    * Opera
* Protocols
  * http
  * https
  * FTP - File transfer Protocols
  * file
  * ghost
  * http/2
* Internet/URL/Domains/DNS/IP
  * LAN, WAN..
  * URL - Uniform Resource Locator
    * Protocol
    * Domain
    * Resource to be fetched
  * Domains - Top level: .com, .org, .edu
  * DNS - Domain Name Server
    * Converts a domain name to an IP
  * IP - Internet Protocol
    * General form for IPV4
      * 202.132.1.1
    * 2^32 internet domains can be created for IPV4
    * 2^128 internet domains for IPV6
* Client/Server
  * Resquest/Response model
  * Client - Browser
    * Takes the URL from the User
    * Contacts the DNS to get the IP
    * Contacts the corresponding with a Resquest to a Resource
  * Server
    * hosts content
    * Contains shared resources
    * Always connected to the network
    * Gets requests from clients and responds back with a resouce
